# Final Project

raal4953 CSCI4229/5229 Summer 2017

I tried to approach fictional drawing from different aspects mostly trying to involve squares to make the animals more fictional. I made most of the textures myself to make it more simple and fictional. This project still has some room for improvements that will add a lot to the animals's characters.
